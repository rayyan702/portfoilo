# Velocity — Car-themed Portfolio (Demo)

This is a simple multi-page portfolio demo with a dark neon-red "car" theme.

Files:

- `index.html` — Home page with hero and highlights
- `skills.html` — Skills with progress bars
- `certificates.html` — Space for certificate thumbnails and downloads
- `gallery.html` — Photo gallery with lightbox (uses placeholder images)
- `contact.html` — Contact form with client-side validation
- `styles.css` — Shared styles (dark, neon-red accents)
- `script.js` — Shared JavaScript for lightbox and form handling

How to run:

Open `index.html` (or any page) in your browser. No build step required.

Replace placeholder images and certificate links with your own assets in the `portfolio/` folder.

Notes:
- This is frontend-only. For real message delivery, wire the contact form to a backend or service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
- Images in the gallery currently use `https://via.placeholder.com/` placeholders; swap with your photos.
